    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.

      const article = `Richard Palmer, a royal reporter who has spent the past 20 years covering the monarchy, also thinks the royal machine is to blame here. "There's no doubt that the photoshopping controversy has damaged the Prince and Princess of Wales's reputation in the short term. It's put extra pressure on the couple and their team at an already difficult time.

"I think Kensington Palace is going to have to change its practices now, either by abandoning the type of handout photo that the public has got used to seeing or by issuing the pictures and stating openly that they have been digitally altered to tidy them up."

Touching up royal images to present a certain brand is hardly a new thing. Just look back through the centuries to royal paintings — Elizabeth I and Henry VIII come to mind — and, of course, celebrity portraits are regularly enhanced using Photoshop. But with this news, previous images of the Wales family will now be under scrutiny.

"It seems clear that royal pictures have been touched up and manipulated down the ages but that won't do any more; the palace has fallen victim to a tightening of standards by the big photographic news agencies amid concerns about AI and deep fake images," says Palmer.

"When the global news director of Agence France-Presse said that Kensington Palace was no longer a trusted source. That's got to hurt. It makes it difficult for the palace to then complain about media ethics.".`;
